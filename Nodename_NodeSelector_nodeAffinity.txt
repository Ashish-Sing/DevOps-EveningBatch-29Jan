

Scheduling in kubernetes using:
****************

NodeName:

Create a yaml file as given below : 
In the spec section of pod, write the node name where you want to scehdule the pod

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kubeserve
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kubeserve
  template:
    metadata:
      name: kubeserve
      labels:
        app: kubeserve
    spec:
      nodeName: gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e18bdb3b-3h5s
      containers:
      - image: leaddevops/kubeserve:v1
        name: app

save the file and execute the yaml

you will see both the pod is scheduled on your mentioned node

Node Selector:
************************

$ kubectl get nodes

every node has multiple labels:

$ kubectl describe node <node Name>


Add your custom labels to all the nodes:

we will add label as  disk=hdd ===>  to node 1 and node 3
we will add lable as  disk=ssd ===> to node 2

$ kubectl label node <nodename1> disk=hdd

$ kubectl label node <nodename3> disk=hdd

$ kubectl label node <nodename2> disk=ssd
kubectl label node gke-cluster-1-default-pool-e18bdb3b-3l9r disk=ssd

Now create a yaml file to deploy pods with node selector

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kubeserve
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kubeserve
  template:
    metadata:
      name: kubeserve
      labels:
        app: kubeserve
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
       disk: ssd
      containers:
      - image: leaddevops/kubeserve:v1
        name: app


Node Affinity
*****************

Here : requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution

this means we will schedule the pods on the matching labels node only but once the pod is running on the pod 
and if labels are removed, still pod will continue to run on the node (this is ignored during execution)

Create a pod with affinity as required

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disk
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd
  containers:
  - name : c1
    image: nginx


Now change the value under node selector terms
where you want to deploy a pod in a node where disk is not ssd


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disk
            operator: NotIn
            values:
            - ssd
  containers:
  - name : c1
    image: nginx

Now pod will be placed on anode 1 or node 2 where disk is hdd


Now give a wrong key value and chnage operator to In

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disk
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd2
  containers:
  - name : c1
    image: nginx


Pod will be in pending state and will not be scheduled.




prefferend during scehduling example

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
         matchExpressions:
          - key: disk
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd234
  containers:
  - name : c1
    image: nginx


Multiple labels. 

Set one more label on the node


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: with-node-affinity
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
         matchExpressions:
          - key: disk
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd234
      - weight: 1
        preference:
         matchExpressions:
          - key: disk
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd234
  containers:
  - name : c1
    image: nginx
