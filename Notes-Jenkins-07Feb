1. It is better that you write and maintain your pipeline code in Github, so that many team members can collaborate to the pipeline
2. it allows version control the changes done on pipelines.

3. How will jenkins read pipeline code from github?

Jenkins uses the concept of Jenkinsfile

It is a simple text file. it has no extention 
Name is preffered as Jenkinsfile
This is the file in which we will maintain pipeline code ->in the Version control tool


Jenkins--> pipelinetemplate--> from github fetch jenkinsfile--> execute pipeline code for you.

Master and Agent Set up
=============================================================

Step 1: create a workder/agent node (VM of type Amazon linux2) on AWS

Step 2: Install git and java on worker node

# yum install git -y
# sudo amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11

Step 3: Create remote root directory on the worker & give permissions for access

cd /tmp

mkdir jenkinsdir

Path: /tmp/jenkinsdir

Give permission to remote root directory

chmod -R 777 /tmp/jenkinsdir

Step 4: Go to master machine and update Jenkins URL

Manage Jenkins> Configure System > update the latest jenkins URL to the current url > save the page


Step 5: On master machine open Agent port

Manage Jenkins> Configure Global Security> scroll down to agents > select random and save the page

Step 6: Configure worker/agent node on master

Manage Jenkins> Manage nodes and clouds

Number of executors= executor = Job ==> 1
remote root directory : /tmp/jenkinsdir
label : linux_node
Usage: only build jobs with matching labels


Launch method: launch agents via SSH

Host: private IP of agent node

Credentials: click on Add button > click on jenkins

Select Kind : SSH username and private key

username: ec2-user

Private key: you will get the private key of the agent node in your local laptop> downloads folder

got the downloads folder of laptop, search for the key(.pemfile)

open the file with notepad and copy the entire text

paste the text in jenkins > under private key


Now select the credials from the drop down.


step 7: Host Key Verification Strategy


Step 7: check if connection is succesfull

Step 8: add agent in the piepline
