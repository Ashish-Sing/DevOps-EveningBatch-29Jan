Docker-compose

If you want to create multiple containers from different images at one go, you will make use of docker tool → docker COMPOSE


Write a file with information of what container we want, what should be image, port, volume, env variable

This file is written in YAML
It is not a programming language
Its not a scriptitng language
Its a file format
It store the data in key and value format

Name of the file is : docker-compose.yml

Docker compose is a tool to be installed on Docker host

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version

Create a compose file

mkdir composedemo
cd composedemo
vim docker-compose.yml

version: '2'

services:

  compose-test:
   image: centos:7
   links:
    - compose-db
   command: sleep infinity
  compose-db:
   image: redis
   expose:
    - "6379"



Press esc :wq!

$ docker-compose up -d

$ docker-compose ps

$ docker-compose exec compose-test /bin/bash 

OR

$ docker-compose exec compose-test sh

On the test container we need to ping DB container (6379)

To do this we need to install ncat package

$ yum install nc -y

Use ncat command to connect to container with name compose-db

$ nc compose-db 6379




ping
+PONG

set name sonal

set day sunday
+OK

get name
$5
sonal

get day
$6

Exit ⇒ out of container

Stop & Delete all containers created using docker-compose file

$ docker-compose down
