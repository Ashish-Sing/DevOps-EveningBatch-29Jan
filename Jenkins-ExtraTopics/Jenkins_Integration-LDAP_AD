Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft technology used to manage computers and other devices on a network. It is a primary feature of Windows Server, an operating system that runs both local and Internet-based servers. Active Directory allows network administrators to create and manage domains & users within a network.For example, an admin can create a group of users and give them specific access privileges on the server. As a network grows, Active Directory provides a way to organize a large number of users into logical groups and subgroups, while providing access control at each level.


Active Directory Benefits
Let me elaborate more on the integration and would like to share the steps that I followed.

Go to Jenkins Dashboard URL >> Manage Jenkins >> Configure Global Security.
Click on ‘Enable Security’ and select ‘Active Directory’ from Security Realm.
Fill all the details in Domains section as received by Windows Administration team :
Domain Name: **********

Domain controller: ********************

Bind DN: CN=UserName,OU=Users,OU=**,DC=***,DC=*****,DC=****

Bind Password: ************

TLS Configuration: (InSecure) Trust all Certificates

Note: Here, UserName is Service account name through which we need to setup AD Authentication for Jenkins Dashboard.

Now please click on ‘Test Domain’. This will reply back as “Success” if all the entries are correct otherwise check with Windows team.

4. Now Go to Authorization section >> Matrix based security

Here we can segregate the Access level as per the task matrix. We have segregated in 3 levels.

4(a). Anonymous Users: View access only [No Need to login]

4(b). Authenticated Users: View Access only [Users Login with Company’s LAN ID]

4(c). In.Jenkins.Admin: DevOps/Release team to perform Build/Deploy tasks.

Click on ‘Add users or groups’ to add new users and AD groups. Click on Apply and Save.

That’s it. Now the users can access Jenkins Dashboard through their LAN ID with AD password.

This has made a life simpler for Jenkins administrator in terms of :

Secure and Centralized Authentication mechanism.
Automatic addition and deletion of users from Jenkins as synced with AD.
View access for all authenticated users. (User can view all projects, modules and console output)
No need to maintain local DB in Jenkins.
Quick check by Development Leads for project specific jobs.
